>Quantifiable business outcomes (ROI, efficiency gains, cost savings)
>Lessons learned and how you adapted strategies mid-project

## 1. University of Wisconsin Platteville - College of Business, International Business Office partnership with John Deere

As a Program Manager for 4 years at the University, I partnered with the International Business professor to assist in the creation of a grant for the US Department of Education. This grant requires, proposal writeups to create a partnership between the Platteville University and Lagos Business school in Nigeria to create a cross-faculty trade facilitating agricultural studies between both schools, as well as providing an agenda and purchase agreements for John Deere tractors and farming equipment to Nigeria. This required collaboration with college faculty, letters of support from US Senators and Governors, as well as the delegation from the Nigerian government. This partnership was approved by the US Department of Education in excess of $400,000 to permit the partnership and create programs between faculties such as cross-training and visits from the government officials to UW-Platteville.

> This effort was useful in meeting members of an African Government group, formulating letters to convince and persuade both officials and delegates for a business agreement, in addition to leading a team of 6 other developers. Working with the US Department of Education in obtaining a grant was an excellent career builder. Other programs in our domain included preparing business trips for University students to Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, and China were excellent building blocks to learn about conducting business abroad, promoting trade, and starting partnerships in unfamiliar cultures.

## 2. Test Data Management Project

Information Management Engineer at Thrivent Financial (Fortune 500) - I was tasked with conducting application, data, and infrastructure analysis for a 5 year, $8 million enterprise data management project. I worked personally with over 40 cross-functional business and IT teams in the organization (BA's, IT SME's, managers, and directors), educating their teams in our new platform capabilities and test data services. I facilitated the implementation of our features and stories as a Scrummaster for 2 years, and personally implemented over 800+ ETL workflows to production. During my 6 years at Thrivent, I served as the primary IT SME for the Test Data Management team, overseeing the entire monthly data obfuscation process which includes Informatica ETL, mainframe COBOL application controls, job monitoring, and stored procedures to update the entire Enterprise data sources in excess of 80 databases (DB2, SQL Server, Oracle, IMS, PostgresSQL, MongoDB, Neo4J). I also trained over 15 team members on our operations and infrastructure processes, devised project documentation for over 40 in-house apps, and formulated technical documentation totaling 100+ pages as a reference document together with training videos for off-shore teams to follow, facilitating their onbooarding process.

This was a very strong foundational project as an Engineer because it provided me with several hundreds of ours working directly with Senior IT SMEs, Business Analysts, Architects, and Managers facilitating me in identifying application infrastructure together with the business functions implemented for each application of team in our plan. In total, being given the experience and collaboration experience of over 150 team members who shared their IT knowledge, business acumen, and corporate expertise, resulted in a significant career builder assisting me with a strong overall picture of how the corporate environment operates together with the business functions that operate to support these processes. 


## 3. Variabilize Seed Values Project 

At Thrivent  Financial, I led an 18-month $350,000 project to revise the waterfall-inspired Test Data Management project (see #2 above) to modify each the 900 ETL workflows automated in production to programmatically change the obfuscation seed values should a privacy breach occur. In the event of a security breach of our masking activities of our productionalized customer data (PII, HIPAA, Investment, Portfolios, and more) the proposed project changes the key stores in an automated fashion changing the encryption parameters and re-creating the obfuscated data immediately. This project prevents over 2 years of work to update the entire corporate data function assuming a complete data breach to a span of 2-3 days, making it a cost-effective decision to implement. The project was completed unde-budget and ahead of schedule, permitting us to update our project scope to accelerate our monthly obfuscation activity which spans from 4 - 10 days, reducing it to a 36-48 hour execution, reducing the data-downtime for our Business Analysts, managers, and engineers to access their use cases, operational and test data.

This was a useful project requiring few resources or off-shore staff assisting our team in the completion of this effort. During the digital transformation effort modernizing our cloud, devops infrastructure led us to the implementation of new Data Warehouses and Data Lakes, allowing our teams to integrate and facilitate the operation of our meta-data applications, data dictionaries, and business glossaries.
